Hi, if you're reading this, then you're another creature
trying to learn more about the whole new world where
Javascript can be used as backend technology for you app.

For this example follow these steps before anything else:
1 - Install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/
2 - Install Git https://git-scm.com/downloads
3 - After installing, choose a directory in your machine where
	your project is or where ou want it to be
4 - Put the Vagrantfile and vconfig.sh in you project directory,
	it's a good practice to put it out of the directory which
	you're going to share, along with other configuration files
5 - Right-click in the directory where you put Vagrantfile
6 - Left-click Git Bash
7 - When the command window opens, insert $ vangrant up, it will
	take a few minutes to create your VM.
	TIP: Use $ vagrant halt to close VM softly.

NOTE: You'll need to do a vagrant up everytime to open
your machine, but it's faster, since VM is already created.

Now you have a server up and runnig. :}

That's all folks.
